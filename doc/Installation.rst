Installing Swoop
================

Installing Swoop is easy with pip::

  $ pip install Swoop
  

Dependencies
------------

Swoop depends on three packages: `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_ (for XML parsing) and `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_  (for
generating :code:`Swoop.py`), and `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ (for generating the documentation).  If you want to install them by hand with :code:`pip`::

  $ pip install lxml jinja2 Sphinx
