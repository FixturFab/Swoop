Installing Swoop
================

Swoop is avalable via PyPi.  It depends on a few other packages -- namely
`lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_ (for XML parsing) and `Jinja2
<http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_ (for generating :code:`Swoop.py`), and
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ (for generating the documentation).

Installation
------------

Once you have installed pip, you can install Swoop with::
  
  $ easy_install Swoop

or, if you need to use :code:`sudo` for installation (e.g., if you are on Mac),
you can do::

  $ sudo easy_install Swoop

You can also install Swoop and its dependences with pip::

  $ pip install lxml jinja2 Sphinx Swoop
